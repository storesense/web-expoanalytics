                <p>“It usually takes a while for exhibitors to analyse the value of event attendance and decide to attend the next event. Using Expo analytics we were able to prove the value during the event itself, which helped raise our rebooking rates and dramatically shortened our rebooking times.”</p>

                <p>“Delivering ROI to the exhibitors is key to a successful event. Traditional measuring methods make it difficult as they are typically dependent on the exhibitors. With Expo analytics delivering a complete event overview we could prove the value of event attendance and are in a great position to help the exhibitors receive even more value from the next event.”

                        “Expo Analytcs provided Ogilvy with the ability to layer our interaction data and analytics from other interactions (video, touch screen, interactive exhibitions) on the congress stand. It enabled us to truly understand the interactions and impact of our activities in a holistic way. No longer are we limited to measuring one person’s interaction with a single tactic, but can understand how that affects others on the stand and the overall dynamic. The insights and recommendations from Expo Analytics throughout and in the final report are based on their large knowledge and history of working at conferences, which was really valuable to us."</p>

                        <p>"Expo Analytics has been incredibly supportive throughout the whole project; providing the right documents and answers when facing legal and privacy challenge questions from varied stakeholders. It was an excellent experience and we’d love to work with them again in due course." raise our rebooking rates and dramatically shortened our rebooking times.”
